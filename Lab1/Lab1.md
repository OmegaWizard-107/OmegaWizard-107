## Part 3 - Command Line Navigation

My OS is:
- [] Windows
- [x] Linux
- [] Mac

My Command Line Shell is: bash

### Navigating My OS on the Command Line

1. Full / absolute path to your user's home directory: pwd
2. Create a directory named `DirA`: mkdir DirA
3. Create a directory named `Dir B`: mkdir 'Dir B'
4. Go into `DirA`: cd DirA
5. Go into `Dir B` from `DirA`: cd ~/'Dir B'/
6. Return to your user's home directory: cd
7. Create a file named `test.txt`: touch test.txt
8. Move the file named `test.txt` into `DirA`: mv test.txt ./DirA/
9. Contents of `test.txt`: vim test.txt
```
You can do it!
```
10. Make a copy of `test.txt` named `copy.txt` in `DirA`: cp ./DirA/test.txt ./DirA/copy.txt
11. View the contents of `DirA`: ls ./DirA/
12. Make a copy of `test.txt` in `Dir B` named `fodder.txt`: cp ./DirA/test.txt ./'Dir B'/fodder.txt
13. Delete / remove both `fodder.txt` AND `Dir B`: rm -rf 'Dir B'
